The attached code can compute simulations for screening using antigen tests in schools and workplaces.
It is flexible to change conditions for the screening simulation in the code.

1) 'populationParameters_sym.txt' and 'populationParameters_asym.txt' are the estimated parameters of viral dynamics model for symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients, respectively.
2) 'Fig1G.R' does screening simulations for Figure 1G in the Manuscript.
3) 'Fig2.R' does screening simulations for Figure 2 in the Manuscript.
4) 'Fig3.R' does screening simulations for Figure 3 in the Manuscript.
5) 'Fig4_XXX.R' does screening simulations for Figure 4 in the Manuscript.

* Text files and R codes above should be in the same location.
